# Sync Service

The Sync Service npm package is a powerful tool for synchronizing data across multiple devices and platforms. It provides a seamless and efficient way to keep data in sync, ensuring that changes made on one device are reflected on all other devices.

## Features

- Real-time synchronization: The Sync Service ensures that data changes are made locally in real-time, handling cloud synchronization in the background.

- Conflict resolution: The sync service prioritizes the most recent versions of resources

- Cross-platform compatibility: The Sync Service is designed to work across different platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop applications, making it easy to integrate into any project.

- Scalability: The Sync Service is built to handle large amounts of data and can scale effortlessly as your application grows. It also allows synchronization operations to be merged together to save bandwidth. For instance, creating and deleting the same resource will cancel out.

- Offline-Compatible: The Sync Service is meant for offline compatibility, meaning your device should be able to run completely offline, then sync back to the cloud once your connection is restored. 

## Installation

To install the Sync Service npm package, simply run the following command:

```
npm install node-js-light-sync
